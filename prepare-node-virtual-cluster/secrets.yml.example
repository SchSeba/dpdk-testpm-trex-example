# Instructions to generate GitHub runner tokens:
# 1. Go to your repository on GitHub
# 2. Navigate to Settings > Actions > Runners
# 3. Click "New self-hosted runner"
# 4. Copy the token from the configuration command
# 5. Paste it above for the corresponding key_name

# You'll need to regenerate them each time you run this playbook
# for new runners.
